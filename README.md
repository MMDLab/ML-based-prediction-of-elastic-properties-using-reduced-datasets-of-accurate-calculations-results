# ML-based prediction of elastic properties using reduced datasets of accurate calculations results
---
This repository contains data, described in the paper "Machine learning-based prediction of elastic properties using reduced datasets of accurate calculations results" and includes databases, algorithms and ML-models. In this paper pipelines for ML-models were generated using TPOT and used to improve the predictons of various elastic properties of Ti and Zr alloys. The main concept of this work is creation of two models for each property trained in a specific way, in which the first one is trained on large datatset with less accurate calculations made using EMTO-CPA and the second is trained on the much smaller dataset from more accurate PAW-SQS calculations and prediction results from the first model.
